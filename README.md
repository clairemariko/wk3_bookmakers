# wk3_bookmakers
app development

<h2>Things I achived in this homework:</h2>
bookmakers can create, edit and delete.
Also the top nav bar you can click on All tags and it will come up with a list of all the bookmarks
There is a confirmation page after you have created a bookmark.
search engine:
I read through query string however the examples on stack overflow just confused me more. 
My idea is :
Post /searches #create a new search
Get /searches #list all searches

So for searching genre it would be something like:
Post '/bookmark/search' do
      create a search
      
    /title?genre=id  the user serches by genre to find a specific title?

<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
I don't have much experience of using html and css so did the beginers in Treehouse and Code School. 
I followed Treehouse example and used what they were teaching into my CSS to practice. 
Once I got my layout page to talk to my homepage, i started enjoying it.
However it is also really like this :

Main things I want to figure out are:
how to make my profile image sit within my header and make my headers background span the width of the whole header.
How can I target specific roots to apply my html and not have it apply to all....
How to make my box sit next to each other not one under the other.
